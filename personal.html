                    <h2>1. Discovery</h2>
                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                        <p>I first carried out a competitive analysis of several websites to narrow down the best design to showcase my portfolio. Through this process of selecting the layout of my website which focuses on emphasizing my work, capabilities, and passions, I can provide the insights I discovered.</p>
                    <h2>INSIGHTS</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Display content with maximization of skimmability, spacing, and accessibility in mind</li>
                            <li>Know my design process</li>
                            <li>Gather purposeful artifacts to arrange in presentable manner</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Navigation Diagrams</h3>
                        <p>To maximize user interface and prevent the potential problems that arise as my portfolio adjusts over time, I decided on a simple the navigation menu design.</p>
                        <p>*image*</p>
                        <p>While the initial framework looks more simple, there is too much clicking to do on the menu tabs. Putting my resume on its own tab makes it easier and faster for people to access what is needed in a concise manner due to reducing the clickstream needed to find certain materials.</p>
                    <h3>Organize Information</h3>
                        <p>Streamlining the creation process, I created an organization system to easily access media, documents, and previous work. This allowed for it to be easily to assemble the structures of my online portfolio.Â </p>

                <div class = "personal-2">
                    <h2>2. Design</h2>
                        <p>The inspiration for the template came from various bright website portfolios through the competitive analysis search. Through trial and error, I complied a general list to set as the criteria for my portfolio in order to make it both reflective of myself as well as professional.</p>
                        <h2>INSIGHTS</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Constraints due to rudimentary programming knowledge</li>
                            <li>Users are focused on seeing work samples</li>
                            <li>Color palette and chosen fonts must be in collaboration with usability and scrollability</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                        <p>I initially had two parts to the top navigation bar. The home page would serve as the origin point for all sources of information, but it also had the ability to display more information when users click on what they were specifically looking for.</p>
                        <p>*image*</p>
                    <h3>Branding & Mockups</h3>
                        <p>After focusing on the specific types of information users want to see in a concise and easy manner, I started creating the branding guidelines and mockups. Displayed below is the progression of my mockups.</p>

                    <h2>3. Development</h2>
                    <h3>Prototypes and Coding (HTML & CSS)</h3>
                        <p>I created the functionality with Visual Studio using HTML and CSS, transforming the Figma prototype onto the portfolio. Afterwards, I published the site. </p>
                </div>
                <div class = "personal-4">
                    <h2>4. Analysis</h2>
                    <h3>User Testing</h3>
                        <p>After conducting a survey with 20 participants who were asked to test out the website, I received feedback that would be incorporated into the next iteration of the web design.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Purpose was hard to immediately distinguish from the home page</li>
                            <li>Landing page seemed clustered, too plain, and was missing something that would make it stand out</li>
                            <li>Case study should be the focal point for both the home page and the "Works" page</li>
                            <li>Pathways were not as intuitive as anticipated</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Revisions</h3>
                        <p>With the insights in mind, I made the necessary changes to my portfolio. Participants emphasized how the website should immediately direct them to the case studies.</p>
                    <h3>Iteration</h3>
                        <p>Though developing an iterative user testing protocol, I could note the effectiveness of some aspects of the revised designs. I designed, received feedback, and incorporated. Then repeated this iteration. <br> After several iterations of testing, I finalized the refined design to incorporate the needs to users as well as my personal aspects.</p>
